As a community of people passionate about accessibility, we are committed to providing the most accessible experience possible.

Our venue, Seattle Central College, is physically accessible. Visit their website for more accessibility information: [https://seattlecentral.edu/campus-life/student-support-and-services/disability-support/accommodations](https://seattlecentral.edu/campus-life/student-support-and-services/disability-support/accommodations)

We plan to have live transcription available at the event. However, it would help us greatly to know how many people need these services as we have a limited budget. Please let us know during [registration](../registration) if you need interpreters or live transcription.

If you have any special needs we should know about, please contact us as soon as possible: [info@accessibilitycampseattle.org](mailto: info@accessibilitycampseattle.org)
