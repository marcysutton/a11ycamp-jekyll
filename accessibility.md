As a community of people passionate about accessibility, we are committed to providing the most accessible experience possible at Seattle Accessibility Camp.

Our venue, Seattle Central College, is physically accessible. Visit their website for more accessibility information: [https://seattlecentral.edu/campus-life/student-support-and-services/disability-support/accommodations](https://seattlecentral.edu/campus-life/student-support-and-services/disability-support/accommodations)

We plan to have live transcription available at the event; ASL interpreters are available on request. It would help us greatly to know if you would need ASL to attend the event. Please let us know during [registration](../registration) by Wednesday, May 8th, so we can make sure you have a great experience at camp!

If you have any other needs or accommodations we should know about, please contact us before the event: [info@accessibilitycampseattle.org](mailto: info@accessibilitycampseattle.org)
