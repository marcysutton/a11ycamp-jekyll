As a community of people passionate about accessibility, we are committed to providing the most accessible experience possible.

Our venue, the Seattle Public Library, is physically accessible and provides a range of services and adaptive equipment. Visit SPL for more accessibility information: [http://www.spl.org/using-the-library/get-help/ada--special-services](http://www.spl.org/using-the-library/get-help/ada--special-services)

We plan to have CART services available at the event. However, it would help us greatly to know how many people need these services as we have a limited budget. Please let us know during [registration](../registration) if you need interpreters or live transcription.

If you have any special needs we should know about, please contact us as soon as possible: [info@accessibilitycampseattle.org](mailto: info@accessibilitycampseattle.org)
