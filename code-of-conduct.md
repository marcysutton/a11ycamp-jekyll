## The Quick Version

Our unconference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of disability, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference session, including talks, workshops, after-party events, and social media.

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to disability, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention of any kind.

Participants and sponsors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant or sponsor engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their badges or their location at the information desk.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants do whatever they need to do to feel safe, including contact venue security and/or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment, for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and want to do whatever we need to help you feel safe.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the venue and unconference-related social events.
