Description: 
Accessibility Camp Seattle is an "unconference" that brings people together from design, technology and disability communities to discuss the accessibility of digital materials. Registration is required. Description: 
Talk and brainstorm about digital inclusion with people who are passionate about providing digital material access for all.

Accessibility Camp Seattle is a community-facilitated, participant-driven event. It is different from a standard conference, where the information flows from a speaker to attendees.

At this event, the agenda is set by you and all attendees are encouraged to speak and listen. In other words, we want the information to flow multiple ways! We want to hear what you have to say. We want you to find other people who care about the same things you do and for you to start talking at this unconference, and then to keep talking and building after the event is over.

Still curious about what an "unconference" or "digital accessibility" is? Check out this blog post from last year's event: http://shelftalk.spl.org/2012/05/22/accessibility-camp-seattle-2012/.
