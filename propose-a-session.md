So, you’re coming to our unconference event–is there a specific session you’d hope to attend? We’re taking proposals ahead-of-time for unconference sessions focused on anything related to accessibility, both on-and-offline. Here are a few potential tracks for inspiration:

- Web Accessibility
- Inclusive Gaming
- Real World Accessibility
- Accessibility Policy
- Standards and Guidelines
- Assistive Technologies

On the day of the event, we’ll mix submissions from the group in with your proposals to facilitate the most effective use of the day we can. It’s okay to submit more than one session, however, we can’t guarantee yours will be accepted.

Goals for the day include:

- Learning new things about accessibility
- Gaining empathy for our fellow humans
- Community building
- Identifying solutions to our challenges

To submit an unconference session, you have three options:

- Include it when you [register for the event](../registration).
- Contact us to submit at [info@accessibilitycampseattle.org](mailto: info@accessibilitycampseattle.org).
- Contribute your session in person, at the event.
